# The_Complete_Guide_To_Fasting

## Fasting Timeline

### 0-4 Hours Anabolic
* food breaks down into glucose, amino acids, fatty acids
* This is the primary cellular growth period
* insluin (the anabolic hormone) increases to increase updake of glucose into the muscles, liver, and fat.
* [leptin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/leptin/) (the satiety hormone) is released from fat stores
* [ghrelin](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/ghrelin/) (the hunger hormone) decreases.
* 

### 4-16 Hours Catabolic
* at 4 hours, insulin and ghrelin levels return to baseline.
* Glucagon (the liver glycogen summoning hormone) steadily increases.
* The liver secretes glycogen to keep blood sugars in range
* At the 12 hour mark, the body is in the fasted state, as fat becomes the primary focus for fuel
* 

### 16-24 Hours Fat Burning

### 24-72 Hours Ketosis
